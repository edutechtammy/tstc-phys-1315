## Lesson Upgrade Resource Checklist: M1L1 Significant Figures and Scientific Notation

Before upgrading or reviewing the lesson, please provide or confirm the following resources:

- [ ] 1. **High-Quality, Relevant Images**  
    - (Best as separate files in the Files folder; reference filenames/URLs in JSON if needed)
- [ ] 2. **Specialized Media/Diagrams**  
    - (Best as separate files; reference in JSON if interactive or required for lesson logic)
- [ ] 3. **CidiLabs Interactive Templates**  
    - (Describe structure in JSON if custom logic is needed; otherwise, standard widgets need not be listed)
- [ ] 4. **Branding/Accessibility Guidelines**  
    - (Summarize key requirements in JSON under `branding_guidelines`)
- [ ] 5. **Extra Enrichment/Deeper Dive Resources**  
    - (List URLs and descriptions in JSON under `enrichment_links`)
- [ ] 6. **Career Connection Details**  
    - (Summarize in JSON under `career_connections`)
- [ ] 7. **Assessment/Practice Item Pool**  
    - (List practice questions and answers in JSON under `practice_questions`; full quizzes/tests may be separate files)
- [ ] 8. **Instructor/Institutional Preferences**  
    - (Summarize key notes in JSON if relevant to lesson logic; otherwise, keep as separate documentation)

### Guidance: What Goes in the JSON File?

**Ideally included in the lesson JSON file:**
- Enrichment links (URLs, descriptions)
- Practice questions (with answers)
- Career connections (summaries, talking points)
- Branding/accessibility guidelines (key requirements)
- Instructor/institutional notes (if brief and lesson-specific)

**Best kept as separate files or documentation:**
- Images, diagrams, and media files (store in Files folder, reference in JSON if needed)
- Full assessment/test banks (unless short, otherwise as separate files)
- Detailed interactive scripts or templates (if complex)
