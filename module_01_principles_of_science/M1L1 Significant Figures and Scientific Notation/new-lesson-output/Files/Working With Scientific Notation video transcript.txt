Hello, I am Dr. Jason Mast, and in this brief lecture, I'm going to go over computing quantities with scientific notation. The first method and probably the simplest one is to use a scientific calculator. Most scientific calculators will have an E or double E button. For example, on this scientific calculator, the double E button is towards the bottom on the left column. If you press this, it will separate the number and the exponent that you can see on the screen above. In most scientific or engineering computer programs, you can just type in lowercase or capital E character to separate the number and the exponent. So for example, 6.626 times 10 to the power of negative 34 can be written as 6.626E negative 34. Once you've entered your value using this E notation, you can use multiplication, addition, subtraction, or division just as you would any other quantity, and the calculator will get all the precision correct for you. However, in Canvas, you must enter the notation like this. So it would be 6.626 and you'd say times using the asterisk character 10 raised to the power, and here you use the caret, which would be shift 6 on the keypad, and then in this case the exponent would be negative 34. The second method is great if you don't have a scientific calculator, and this is where you will separate the number and the exponent and do the arithmetic for both and then combine them at the end. And the best way to explain it to you is by example. So let's say for example I want to multiply these three numbers then divide by this divisor. So I will color them red, green, blue, and purple to distinguish the number and exponent from each other. So we have the first number is 6.626 times 10 to the power of negative 34 multiplied by 3.00 times 10 to the power of 8, and that is multiplied by 1.56 times 10 to the power of 20, and the product of those three numbers is divided by 245 times 10 to the power of negative 9. So the first thing I'm going to do is move all of the numbers to the left, and I'm going to put all of the powers of 10 to the right. So on the left we have 6.626 times 3.00 times 1.56, and that product is divided by 245. You see that with those four numbers there are no powers of 10. And then I'll say all of that is multiplied by the combination of powers of 10. So it would be 10 to the power of negative 34 times 10 to the power of 8 times 10 to the power of 20 divided by 10 to the power of negative 9. So the quantity on the left after the three numbers are multiplied and then divided by 245 we get 0.127. Then for the exponents we can do the arithmetic with exponents so that when you multiply them you add the exponent and when you divide you subtract. So we get negative 34 plus 8 plus 20 minus negative 9, and once all of that is done you'll get 3. So the answer is 0.127 times 10 to the power of 3. If you're going to use scientific notation then the number has to be between 1 and 10. So it becomes 1.27 times 10 to the power of 2, or it could just be simple and say it's 127. Here are our four practice problems for you to perform. Go ahead and do them and make sure you get the same answer.
