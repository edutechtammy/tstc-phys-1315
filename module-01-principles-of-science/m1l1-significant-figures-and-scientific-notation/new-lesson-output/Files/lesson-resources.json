            "description": "Engineers use significant figures to ensure design calculations align with real-world material tolerances and safety margins. A misplaced decimal point in stress analysis, for instance, could lead to catastrophic structural failure. Scientific notation is used to manage measurements in electrical engineering, from microvolts to kilovolts, aligning with metric prefixes."

They must ensure that the output of complex computer models or spreadsheets doesn't imply a higher level of precision than the original, raw input data justifies. "
