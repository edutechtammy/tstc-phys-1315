## 1. UNDERSTANDING AI STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS

### What AI Excels At:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learning your style preferences through examples
- **Consistency**: Applying established rules and formats systematically
- **Detail Work**: Handling repetitive tasks with precision
- **Research and Synthesis**: Combining information from multiple sources
- **Code Generation**: Writing clean, functional code following specifications

### What AI Struggles With:
- **Long-term Memory**: Context degrades over extended conversations
- **Implicit Knowledge**: Understanding unstated preferences and assumptions
- **Creative Judgment**: Making subjective decisions without clear criteria
- **Context Switching**: Maintaining quality when jumping between different task types
- **Fatigue Recognition**: Knowing when it's approaching limits

---

## 2. RECOGNIZING AI FATIGUE EARLY

### 🚨 Early Warning Signs:
#### **Quality Degradation**
- Shortcuts appearing: "...as mentioned previously" or "...similar to above"
- Generic responses instead of specific, tailored answers
- Missing details you normally expect
- Repetitive language patterns
- Asking for information already provided in conversation

#### **Behavior Changes**
- Shorter responses when comprehensive answers are expected
- Suggesting to "break this into smaller parts" for normal-sized tasks
- Reverting to basic approaches instead of established patterns
- Using simpler tools when complex ones are appropriate
- Losing track of project-specific requirements

#### **Technical Quality Drops**
- Incomplete implementations missing key features
- Style inconsistencies with established patterns
- More errors or oversights than usual
- Forgetting specific instructions from earlier in conversation

### ⚡ Immediate Response Actions:
1. **Stop Current Task** - Don't push for completion when quality drops
2. **Save Progress** - Document what's been accomplished
3. **Start Fresh Conversation** - Begin new session immediately
4. **Provide Context Package** - Share relevant files and previous outputs

## 3. CONVERSATION MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES

### Proactive Refresh Points:
- **Natural Breakpoints**: Start new conversations at module endings or major milestones
- **Task Type Changes**: Refresh when switching between different types of work
- **Token Monitoring**: Start fresh after 15-20 complex interactions
- **Quality Checkpoints**: Monitor response quality every 3-4 exchanges

#### What "Start a New Conversation" Means:
**In Different Platforms:**
- **ChatGPT**: Click "New Chat" or "+ New chat" button
- **Claude**: Click "New Conversation" or "+" button  
- **VS Code/GitHub Copilot**: Clear chat window or start new chat session

**Why This Works:**
- **Fresh Context**: AI has maximum "working memory" available
- **Peak Performance**: No degradation from long conversation history
- **Clear Focus**: No confusion from earlier, unrelated tasks
- **Consistent Behavior**: Eliminates drift from conversation patterns

**Timing Examples:**
```
Good breakpoints:
✅ Completed Module 3 → Start new for Module 4
✅ Finished Canvas conversion → Start new for style guide creation  
✅ Done with M7L1-L4 → Start new for M8-M9
✅ Completed 15-20 complex exchanges → Refresh proactively

Poor timing:
❌ Middle of converting a single lesson
❌ During active troubleshooting  
❌ When AI is performing well and on track
```

### Effective Context Loading:
```
New Conversation Opener Template:
"I'm continuing work on [specific project]. 

Completed so far: [brief list of accomplishments]
Current task: [specific next step]
Reference materials: [attach style guide/examples]

Please review the attached [style guide/previous work] before proceeding."
```

### Conversation Structure Best Practices:
- **Lead with most important context** first
- **Use reference documents** rather than re-explaining requirements
- **Verify understanding** before starting complex work
- **Break large tasks** into discrete, completable chunks
- **Document decisions** as you go, not retroactively

---

## 4. TASK PLANNING AND CHUNKING

### Optimal Task Sizing:
- **Per Conversation**: 2-3 lessons or 1 major deliverable maximum
- **Per Request**: Complete one full task before starting next
- **Quality Check**: Verify output quality before proceeding
- **Scope Boundaries**: Define clear start/stop points

### Project Planning Strategy:
1. **Map the Full Scope**: Understand total work required
2. **Identify Natural Chunks**: Break into logical, completable pieces
3. **Create Handoff Points**: Plan where conversations will transition
4. **Prepare Context Packages**: Have reference materials ready for each phase

### Example Task Chunking:
```
Instead of: "Convert all M3-M9 lessons for Canvas compatibility"

Better approach:
- Conversation 1: Process M3 lessons (3 lessons)
- Conversation 2: Process M4 lessons (2 lessons)  
- Conversation 3: Process M5-M6 lessons (3 lessons)
- etc.
```

## 5. DOCUMENTATION AND KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER

### Create Living Documents:
- **Style Guides**: Document preferences, patterns, and requirements
- **Example References**: Save successful outputs as templates
- **Decision Logs**: Record important choices and rationales
- **Process Documentation**: Note what works and what doesn't

### Handoff Preparation:
- **Context Packages**: Pre-prepare files and examples for new conversations
- **Clear Objectives**: Write specific, actionable task descriptions
- **Success Criteria**: Define what "done" looks like
- **Reference Materials**: Include style guides and examples

### Between AI Systems:
- **Explicit Knowledge Transfer**: Convert implicit understanding to written guides
- **Template Creation**: Provide concrete examples rather than descriptions
- **Process Documentation**: Share successful workflow patterns
- **Quality Standards**: Document acceptable vs. unacceptable outputs

---

## 6. COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES

### Giving Feedback:
- **Be Specific**: "Use more direct student language" rather than "improve the tone"
- **Provide Examples**: Show what you want, don't just describe it
- **Reference Standards**: Point to style guides and previous successful work
- **Immediate Correction**: Address issues as soon as you notice them

### Setting Expectations:
- **Clear Scope**: Define exactly what needs to be accomplished
- **Quality Standards**: Reference specific examples of acceptable work
- **Constraints**: Clearly state limitations (Canvas compatibility, etc.)
- **Success Metrics**: Explain how you'll evaluate the output

### Effective Prompting:
```
Weak: "Make the lesson better"
Strong: "Update this lesson to match the M2L1 style guide, ensuring:
- Direct student engagement using 'you' language
- Career connections to technical fields
- dp-wrapper structure for Canvas compatibility
- 2-3 CidiLabs interactive activities"
```
